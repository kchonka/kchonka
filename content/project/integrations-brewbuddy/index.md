## Introduction
---

At BrewBuddy, we believe that brewing coffee is a science. To help you craft the perfect brew, BrewBuddy seamlessly integrates with a variety of assistive tools and apps. This article is a brief overview of BrewBuddy’s integration capabilities. <br><br>


## 1. Smart Scales
---

A smart scale is a device that accurately measures kitchen ingredients and sends the information to a smartphone app. Smart scales are helpful in coffee brewing, as they can measure coffee and water with precision down to 0.01 grams. Precision measuring can enhance coffee flavor and consistency by ensuring the correct coffee-to-water ratios.<br>

BrewBuddy can integrate with several smart scales by syncing measurements to the app via Bluetooth. This integration lets you conveniently monitor and control your brews directly from the Recipe screen. <br>

**Supported Devices:**

- Acaia Pearl Scale
- Hario V60 Drip Scale
- Brewista Smart Scale II
- Felicita Incline Smart Scale
- Timemore Black Mirror Basic

<br>

## 2. Coffee Grind Apps
---

BrewBuddy integrates with many coffee grind apps, such as Coffee Grind and Filtru. These apps recommend an ideal grind size based on your brewing method, desired coffee strength, and bean type. Using the optimal grind size, you can extract the best possible flavor from your coffee.<br>

BrewBuddy integrates with these apps by syncing your preferences and parameters, eliminating the need to enter duplicate information in two different places manually. Pairing these apps with BrewBuddy can enable you to better manage and optimize your brews in one place.<br>

**Supported Apps:**
- Coffee Grind
- Coffee Book
- Filtru
- iBrewCoffee

<br>

## 3. Water Quality Apps
---

Water quality plays an important role in coffee's taste. High-quality water can enhance coffee flavor, bringing out coffee beans' nuanced notes and characteristics. A water quality app can provide detailed information on the mineral content, pH levels, TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), and overall water quality. This information can be used to make adjustments that can improve coffee brews. <br>

BrewBuddy integrates with several water quality apps by syncing water quality information to the app and further analyzing it. Based on water quality data, BrewBuddy can suggest adjusting brewing parameters or using specific water treatment methods to optimize your brews. <br>

**Supported Apps:**
- AquaPure
- WaterCheck
- WaterWise
- H2O Quality Monitor
- Water Test

## Conclusion
